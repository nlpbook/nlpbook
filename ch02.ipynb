    "Now that you've been introduced to the field of natural language processing, there's something imporant you need to understand. It's not actually a very long journey from where you start to state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we _will_ return to the basics, discuss the fundamentals, and understand all the details, of course. But we're going to show you the promised land before we venture on the long and hard journey to get there.\n",
    "    \n",
    "One of the most important ideas to implement if you want to get deep learning working in the real world is transfer learning, which is the process of taking a model that has already been trained on another dataset and fine-tuning it to fit your new dataset. For example, if you're training a language model to generate compelling short stories in the style of Hemingway, you could fine-tune a model trained on a wide variety of books instead of training on just the text samples of Hemingway, of which there may not be many.\n",

    ".Who's That Pokémon? Language Models\n",
    "> Tip: A language model is a function that takes in a sequence of words and returns a probility distribution over all the possible next words in that sequence. This task is considered one of the most important in NLP because, as the reasoning goes, to predict the next word in a sentence, you **must** have a good understanding of the language. Language models learn the features and characteristics of language in order to guess what the next word should be after any given prior phrase or sentence. Language models are the backbone of NLP today because they do not require explicit annotations (labels) and can be trained on massive corpuses without any material data preparation. Once they learn the properties of language well, language models can be fine-tuned to perform more specific NLP tasks such as text classification, which is exactly what we're going to do in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: When we refer to pretrained models throughout this book, we are generally referring to large, pretrained *language* models that have been trained to perform language modeling on large corpuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice analogy in object-oriented programming is the concept of inheritance in classes. Suppose we're making some sort of zoo management video game, where each animal is represented by a class. The animals have properties like weight and height, as well as functions like eat and sleep. In theory, we could just create a new class for each animal and replicate those shared functions, but in practice, we usually refactor our code so that we have a superclass for a generic animal and a subclass for each species to avoid duplication in our code, making it easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training on the larger dataset, the model essentially inherits a large amount of extra knowledge, which it can use to perform better on the task you care about. From a practical standpoint, transfer learning helps you get better performing models faster since fine-tuning, if done correctly, is often computationally cheaper than training from scratch.footnote:[Assuming that the original dataset you're transferring *from* is much larger than the dataset you're using for fine-tuning. If your fine-tuning dataset is larger, perhaps you should be applying transfer learning the other way around! But in practice, it's very hard to natural language text datasets that are of comparable size to the ones used for pretraining.]\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big advancement we'll discuss is the use of a new kind of model architecture called the transformer. Training transformers can be complicated and does not always work well without some fine-tuning. So, instead of traning it from scratch, we'll show you the pretraining technique on another architecure, and the use a popular pre-trained transformer to perform inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this chapter, it's important that you have your compute environment set up since we'll be training models. Check out our [Github page](https://github.com/nlpbook/nlpbook/) for more info on how to do this."

    "In Python, you can actually do this! You have to define `__call__` method in your class, which is a special function called a dunder method. Python has a lot of these cool dunder functions, some of which you've likely encounter before, like `__init__`, which let's you set up a constructor for your class, and `__len__`, which let's you define a \"length\" property for your objects which you can access via the `len()` function. Python dunder methods allow you to define a lot of cool functionality for your custom classes, such as addition, equality, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you define a function called `__call__()` in your Python class, you can then treat instances of your class as functions, and the `__call__()` function will be invoked everytime you do so. We'll soon talk about PyTorch `nn.Module` objects, which are the building blocks for neural nets. The `nn.Module` class implements the `__call__` function by default. Therefore, every PyTorch model (and submodule) can also be called as a function, which can make your code very neat and tidy. This is why we can both define the +model+ variable and call it as we would for a function at the same time.\n",

To test your understanding of the material so far, try to use a different language model, swap out the prompt, and see if you can get the model to predict a popular quote, phrase, or idiom. Note that to do this, you might need to swap out the tokenizer as well. \n",
